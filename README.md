# NeonSound – Find a Recording Studio

About the project:
This is a responsive business website for NeonSound Studios, a fictional music studio booking website.
The idea is to let visitors find and book professional recording rooms – from live rooms for bands to vocal booths and podcast spaces.

The project is part of a coding sprint where the goal is to practice:

Responsive design (mobile → tablet → desktop)
Layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox
Clean HTML structure with semantic elements (header, main, section, article, footer)
Basic animations and hover effects to bring the site to life

 Features:
 Navigation bar – visible on desktop, hidden on tablet/mobile (hamburger menu can be added later)
 Hero section – headline, tagline, and an animated equalizer accent built with CSS keyframes
 Grid of cards – shows different studios with image, title, description and a “Book now” button
 Responsive layout –

1 column on mobile (<640px)
2 columns on tablet (640–1024px)
4 columns on desktop (>1024px)
Polaroid-style cards – shadows and hover lift effect
CSS animations – equalizer bounce + button/card hover transitions
Footer – simple centered copyright

Tech used for project:
HTML5 for structure
CSS for styling (Grid, Flexbox, media queries, transitions, keyframes)

Layout choices:
Flexbox is used in the header (logo left, navigation right) and inside cards (stack image, text, and button).
CSS Grid is used for the card layout, for creating 1/2/4 column responsive grids.
Animations are done with CSS @keyframes for the sound waves and transition for hover effects.
